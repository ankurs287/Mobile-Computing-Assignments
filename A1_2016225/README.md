## Problem Statement
Create Registration Android app having a form containing TextViews and EditText boxes asking user to enter his/her Name, Roll No,Branch, 4 Course names in first activity containing Submit and Clear buttons with Submit Button Onclick event to show the users the entered information in second activity via Intent and with Clear Button Onclick event to allow the user to  clear the form in the first activity.

For each change in the state of the app, it should LOG in type INFO and provide a Toast showing the change in the state. For example, if the state of the app changes from Resumed to Paused, the log should contain INFO statement saying “State of activity <name_of_the_activity> changed from Resumed to Paused”, similarly for the Toast. The app should LOG and provide Toast for all possible state transitions for each activity.
